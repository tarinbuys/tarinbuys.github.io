I am 22 years old, born and raised in South Africa and I have a passion for ecommerce, beauty and tech. I am a full time student at the University of Nelson Mandela, studying Business Management, and an entrepreneur. I run a beauty ecommerce business and freelance as a website developer (I use my eye for design and page builders such as Elementor).

While creating websites for various businesses, I developed an interest in coding. This lead to me teaching myself through YouTube, courses and practise projects. I'm learning HTML, CSS and Javascript- with the goal of becoming a frontend developer.

I created this GitHub account (and a new Twitter page) to share my progress and projects as someone new to the industry.

Thank you for reading this!
